        "Clue": "This crustacean excretes one of the strongest natural adhesives in the world in order to stick to rocks, piers, ships, and even animals like whales.",
        "AdditionalHint" : "This crustacean has a shell-like covering made up of chitin and calcium plates, which give them a protective rigid structure. ",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Barnacle colonies growing on the hulls of ships actually create huge environmental and economic impact. Barnacle growth can increase the weight and drag of a ship in the water by as much as 60%, increasing fuel usage by as much as 40%! However, barnacles are not all bad, they are important intertidal species! Fossilized barnacles that used to hitch a ride on the backs of humpback and gray whales have been used to help reconstruct ancient migration patterns of whale populations millions of years ago and help us compare migration patterns of whales today.",

        "ArtifactId" : "2",
        "Clue": "This ocean dwelling animal is unlike other fish, it only has one singular continuous fin and does not have gill covers, so to breath it must constantly open and close its mouth.",
        "AdditionalHint" : "This ocean dwelling animal is a long, slim snakelike fish.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "California Moray Eels have a second set of jaws in their throat that extend forward to grab prey with backwards facing teeth that drag the prey back into the throat. This second set of jaws is called pharyngeal jaws. They use this feeding method to mainly eat fish, but also feed on octopus, lobsters and shrimp in the rocky reefs of southern California.",

        "Clue": "This brush-like alternative to teeth is used by large mammals to filter food like plankton, fish and krill out of ocean water.",
        "AdditionalHint" : "This brush-like structure is black and wiry in appearance.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Balene is made out of keratin, the same material that makes up our hair and fingernails. Baleen whales open their mouths wide and expand their throats like a balloon to gulp in huge amounts of seawater and food, then expel the water through their balene, filtering out food to swallow.",

        "Clue": "This now extinct cephalopod resembles modern nautilus and was an abundant predator in the warm shallow sea that covered California 200 million years ago.",
        "AdditionalHint" : "This extinct cephalopod had a tightly wound shell. ",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Previously, one of the explanations for these tightly wound shells was that they were actually coiled-up snakes that turned to stone, earning ammonites the nickname “snake-stones” - but we now know ammonites are not reptiles at all, but cephalopods (the group that includes squids, octopus, cuttlefish, nautilus and ammonites). They believe that ammonites were similar to modern day octopus with 8 arms, but with a shell similar to a nautilus.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "These birds have a ‘topknot’ or head plume made of six overlapping feathers that form the shape of an apostrophe.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Often you will find California Quail running along the ground from one bush to another where they find cover. They are social birds and are primarily found in  groups called a covey. ",
