        "Clue": "This crustacean excretes one of the strongest natural adhesives in the world in order to stick to rocks, piers, ships, and even animals like whales.",
        "AdditionalHint" : "This crustacean has a shell-like covering made up of chitin and calcium plates, which give them a protective rigid structure. ",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Barnacle colonies growing on the hulls of ships actually create huge environmental and economic impact. Barnacle growth can increase the weight and drag of a ship in the water by as much as 60%, increasing fuel usage by as much as 40%! However, barnacles are not all bad, they are important intertidal species! Fossilized barnacles that used to hitch a ride on the backs of humpback and gray whales have been used to help reconstruct ancient migration patterns of whale populations millions of years ago and help us compare migration patterns of whales today.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "This ocean dwelling animal is a long, slim snakelike fish.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "California Moray Eels have a second set of jaws in their throat that extend forward to grab prey with backwards facing teeth that drag the prey back into the throat. This second set of jaws is called pharyngeal jaws. They use this feeding method to mainly eat fish, but also feed on octopus, lobsters and shrimp in the rocky reefs of southern California.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "This brush-like structure is black and wiry in appearance.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Baleen is made out of keratin, the same material that makes up our hair and fingernails. Baleen whales open their mouths wide and expand their throats like a balloon to gulp in huge amounts of seawater and food, then expel the water through their balene, filtering out food to swallow.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "This extinct cephalopod had a tightly wound shell. ",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Previously, one of the explanations for these tightly wound shells was that they were actually coiled-up snakes that turned to stone, earning ammonites the nickname “snake-stones” - but we now know ammonites are not reptiles at all, but cephalopods (the group that includes squids, octopus, cuttlefish, nautilus and ammonites). They believe that ammonites were similar to modern day octopus with 8 arms, but with a shell similar to a nautilus.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "While it is ‘giant’ in comparison to many other bugs, these bugs in California are still only slightly larger than the size of an adult's thumb.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Their bites are very painful, but they won’t kill a human at least… Giant water bugs pierce their prey with a poisonous beak and can kill an animal 50 times its own size with its deadly toxins. Their toxins will slowly paralyze and liquify their prey from the inside out. If you’re looking to avoid getting pinched by these giant water bugs simply avoid hiking barefoot near the freshwater streams in the Santa Monica Mountains. Though their pinch seems scary, their method of parental care is fascinating. During mating season males will carry the fertilized eggs and care for the young after hatching while females will continue to find different mates.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "This bird was famously represented in cartoons as the nemesis of a rather wily coyote.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Unlike depicted in cartoons, Greater Roadrunners cannot run faster than a coyote, but they’re still very fast runners! As opportunistic omnivores (animals that will eat both plants and other animals) roadrunners eat almost anything on the ground, including venomous rattlesnakes and scorpions. When eating rattlesnakes, they will team up and repeatedly peck at the head. For larger prey they will slam it against a rock to make it easier to swallow.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "This mammal has a great bushy grey tail.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Unlike the social introduced fox squirrels, western gray squirrels are actually fairly shy and will run up trees and chirp at you if you are to disturb them. Unfortunately the loss of mature oak and pine forests, road-kill mortality and competition from the more aggressive fox squirrels has caused western gray squirrel populations to decline and they are now extirpated (extinct in a given regions) in some areas of California. To help conserve these unique creatures we need to work together to maintain high quality oak woodlands and pine forests through better fire management strategies and decreasing urban sprawl.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "When the seeds of this plant begin to split open their leathery casing, they resemble the eye of a male deer.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "This California native plant is one of the first to leaf out in the spring, and one of the first to lose its foliage, which allows it to avoid the worst of the summer heat. Buckeye seeds contain poisonous compounds that evolved to deter predators from eating them.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "This detritivore is yellow in appearance.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "There is a long tradition of people picking up banana slugs and kissing them for good luck. And who wouldn’t want to kiss one of these charming critters? But it’s best to leave slugs alone as sweat and contaminants on your skin can be absorbed through the slug’s porous skin, which can be harmful to their health. Banana slug slime is neither solid, nor liquid, but instead is a form of liquid crystal! This fascinating slime can absorb 100 times its weight in water from whatever it touches, and facilitates the transfer of chemicals and nutrients directly into the slugs organs. Scientists have been researching ways to create and use a similar material in place of stitches! The banana slug is the beloved, self-chosen mascot of UC Santa Cruz...GO SLUGS!",

        "AdditionalHint" : "On display here at Lindsay Wildlife Experience we have a small piece of this extinct animal’s tusk on display.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Even animals as large as mammoths need a way to scratch their itches. One such grooming technique was to rub up against large boulders and rocky outcroppings. You can see several such rubbing rocks or mammoth rocks along the Sonoma County coast. These rocky outcrops have patches that were polished smooth by the repeated rubbing of mammoths bodies against the rock surface. The appearance and scratch patterns on these ancient mammoth rocks match perfectly with rubbing rocks used by modern elephants!",

        "CorrectMessage" : "California ground squirrels inhabit many different habitat types ranging from fields to woodlands, the only habitat they don’t use is deserts where the soil is too loose for them to make a burrow! If you see California Ground Squirrels aboveground in the fall and winter those will only be young squirrels as the adults hibernate during that time.",

        "AdditionalHint" : "This evergreen shrub has green rounded leaves.",
        "CorrectMessage" : "Parry’s Manzanita is a California endemic species, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world. In springtime thes shrubs grow clusters of small pinkish-white bell shaped flowers. The fruits of this species of manzanita were a food source for the native Luiseño people of Southern California.",

        "CorrectMessage" : "California Condors are one of the rarest birds in the world and longest living birds in North America with a lifespan of 60 years. Their population declined to only 22 surviving individuals in 1987 leading to one of the most expensive species conservation projects in U.S. history. Some of the primary causes of their nearly extinct population was due to poaching, agricultural chemical use like DDT, lead poisoning (from ingesting lead bullets left in carcasses from hunting) and habitat destruction. In 1987, the U.S. Government captured all remaining California Condors for a captive breeding recovery program in an attempt to recover them from extinction. Though still critically endangered, captive breeding programs have helped recover California Condor populations to 175 individuals in captivity and 329 that have successfully been reintroduced into the wild (Central California and Grand Canyon in Arizona).",

Coral polyps usually have clear bodies. The vibrant colors you see in coral reefs and aquariums are due to algae that grow in the polyps tissue and benefit from a symbiotic relationship with the coral polyps. The algae removes the coral’s waste and uses it to photosynthesize (make its own food), and the coral uses the oxygen and carbohydrates produced by photosynthesis to build its exoskeleton.",
