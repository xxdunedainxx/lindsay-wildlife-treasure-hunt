          "AdditionalHint" : "This crustacean has a shell-like covering made up of chitin and calcium plates, which give them a protective rigid structure. ",
          "CorrectMessage" : "Barnacle colonies growing on the hulls of ships actually create huge environmental and economic impact. Barnacle growth can increase the weight and drag of a ship in the water by as much as 60%, increasing fuel usage by as much as 40%! However, barnacles are not all bad, they are important intertidal species! Fossilized barnacles that used to hitch a ride on the backs of humpback and gray whales have been used to help reconstruct ancient migration patterns of whale populations millions of years ago and help us compare migration patterns of whales today.",

          "AdditionalHint" : "This ocean dwelling animal is a long, slim snakelike fish.",
          "CorrectMessage" : "California Moray Eels have a second set of jaws in their throat that extend forward to grab prey with backwards facing teeth that drag the prey back into the throat. This second set of jaws is called pharyngeal jaws. They use this feeding method to mainly eat fish, but also feed on octopus, lobsters and shrimp in the rocky reefs of southern California.",

          "CorrectMessage" : "Balene is made out of keratin, the same material that makes up our hair and fingernails. Baleen whales open their mouths wide and expand their throats like a balloon to gulp in huge amounts of seawater and food, then expel the water through their balene, filtering out food to swallow.",
