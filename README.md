## General Info

The Lindsay Wildlife Bio-diversity Treasure Hunt is a game featured in the exhibit halls of Lindsay Wildlife experience. The intention is to provide a more immersive experience for visitors at Lindsay Wildlife, by prodividing a cutting edge technological experience when interfacing with exhibit hall features. 

This particular feature is a "Treasure Hunt", where visitors must match a given clue with an exhibit in the exhibit hall via barcode scans associated with various exhibits around the exhibit hall. 

For example, if the visitor is given a clue like "brown furry tailed rodent, which can be found climbing trees around town", that clue would match a squirrel. The visitor must then find the Squirrel exhibit in the exhibit hall and scan the relevant barcode. If the visitor scans the correct barcode, they are given a picture of the exhibit feature and a blurb about the feature, and then can proceed to the next exhibit clue. If they are not correct, they may be given an additional clue to push them in the direction of the correct exhibit.
